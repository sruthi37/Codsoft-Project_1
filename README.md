This project **Detects**, **Recognizes**, and **Applies filters** to faces in real-time using **OpenCV and face-recognition**.





### HOW IT WORKS?


This project detects faces in real-time and applies AI filters using computer vision techniques. It uses OpenCV and deep learning-based models to process images or videos and identify human faces accurately.



### FACE DETECTION (USING OPENCV HAAR CASCADES & DEEP LEARNING MODELS)

**How it works?** 


>**CAPTURE LIVE VIDEO OR LOAD AN IMAGE**  
   - The webcam is activated using OpenCV (`cv2.VideoCapture()`), or an image is loaded from storage.  
   - Each video frame or image is processed separately in a loop.  


>**CONVERT THE IMAGE TO GRAYSCALE**  
   - Since Haar cascades work better on grayscale images, we convert the input image using `cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)`.  


>**APPLY FACE DETECTION ALGORITHM**  
   - The face detection model scans the image and identifies **regions that likely contain a face** based on patterns.  
   - A bounding box is drawn around the detected face using `cv2.rectangle()`.  


>**DISPLAY THE PROCESSED FRAME**  
   - The detected face is highlighted, and the processed frame is displayed in a window.  
   - The system keeps detecting faces in live video until the user presses the **'q'** key to quit.  


>**Key Techniques Used:**  
   - **Haar Cascade Classifier** (Pre-trained XML model)  
   - **Deep Learning-Based Face Detector** (Optional for better accuracy)  


>**CMD Command to Run:**  

    python face_detection.py
 


### FACE RECOGNITION (If Implemented in Future)    

**How Face Recognition Works?** 

In this project, I did not implement face recognition. However, if added, face recognition would work as follows:  


>**LOAD KNOWN FACES FROM A DATASET**  
   - Face images of known individuals are loaded and encoded into numerical representations.  


>**EXTRACT FACE ENCODINGS FROM LIVE VIDEO**  
   - The system detects faces in real-time video and converts them into numerical encodings using a deep learning model.  


>**COMPARE ENCODINGS WITH STORED FACES**  
   - The newly detected face is compared with stored encodings to check for a match.  
   - If the match confidence is above a threshold, the face is **recognized** and the personâ€™s name is displayed.  


>**DISPLAY RESULTS ON SCREEN**  
   - The recognized face is marked with a **bounding box** and the **name of the person** appears.  


>**KEY TECHNIQUES USED (If Implemented):**  
- Deep Learning Face Embeddings (e.g., **ArcFace, FaceNet, or dlib**)  
- Face Distance Calculation for Recognition  


>**CMD Command to Run(If Implemented):**  

    python face_recognition.py



### LIVE AI FILTERS (Fun Feature for Augmented Reality) 

**How It Works?**  


>**DETECT FACE IN LIVE VIDEO**  
   - The face is detected in real-time using OpenCVâ€™s Haar cascade classifier.
     

>**LOAD AN IMAGE FILTER (Example: Sunglasses, Hat, Mask, etc.)**  
   - The overlay filter (e.g., **sunglasses.png**) is loaded using `cv2.imread()`.  
   - The filter must support transparency (RGBA format).  


>**RESIZE AND OVERLAY THE FILTER ONTO THE FACE**  
   - The filter image is resized to match the face dimensions.  
   - A loop runs through every pixel of the filter, overlaying it onto the detected face while maintaining transparency.  


>**DISPLAY THE LIVE VIDEO WITH AI FILTER APPLIED**  
   - The processed video stream is displayed, showing the person wearing the AI filter.  


>**KEY TECHNOLOGIES USED:**  
   - **Image Overlaying (Alpha Blending)** 
   - **Face Landmark Detection (for better placement of filters)**  


>**CMD COMMAND TO RUN:**  

    python live_filter.py

This project successfully detects and enhances human faces in real-time, using AI and image processing techniques.
